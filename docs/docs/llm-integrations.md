# LLM Integration

Readme-ai integrates seamlessly with various Large Language Model (LLM) services to generate high-quality README content. This page details the supported LLM services and how to use them effectively.

## Supported LLM Services

### 1. OpenAI

OpenAI's GPT models are known for their versatility and high-quality text generation.

#### Configuration:
```sh
readmeai --api openai --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

#### Available Models:
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- `gpt-4`
- `gpt-4-turbo`

#### Best Practices:
- Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` for faster generation and lower costs.
- Use `gpt-4` or `gpt-4-turbo` for more complex projects or when you need higher accuracy.

### 2. Ollama

Ollama provides locally-run, open-source language models.

#### Configuration:
```sh
readmeai --api ollama --model llama2
```

#### Available Models:
- `llama2`
- `mistral`
- `gemma`

#### Best Practices:
- Ensure Ollama is running locally before using this option.
- Ollama models run offline, providing privacy and speed benefits.

### 3. Google Gemini

Google's Gemini models offer strong performance across a wide range of tasks.

#### Configuration:
```sh
readmeai --api gemini --model gemini-pro
```

#### Available Models:
- `gemini-pro`

#### Best Practices:
- Gemini models excel at understanding context and generating coherent text.
- Ensure you have the necessary API credentials set up.

### 4. Offline Mode

Offline mode generates a basic README structure without using any LLM service.

#### Configuration:
```sh
readmeai --api offline
```

#### Best Practices:
- Use offline mode for quick boilerplate generation or when you don't have internet access.
- Customize the generated README manually after generation.
