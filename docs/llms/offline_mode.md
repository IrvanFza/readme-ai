# Offline Mode

Offline mode allows you to generate a README without an internet connection. This is useful when you want to quickly generate boilerplate README files.

## Configuration

```sh
readmeai --api offline -r https://github.com/username/project
```

## Offline Mode README Example

- [readme-offline-mode.md]()

???+ note

    - Use offline mode for quick boilerplate generation or when you don't have internet access.
    - Customize the generated README manually after generation.
